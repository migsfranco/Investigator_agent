Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.\\nSummary::\\nBACKGROUND: Precision containment strategies incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)-driven dynamic viral shedding models are pivotal for the effective control of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Among the foundational applications within the Metaverse, digital twins-which integrate physical and virtual environments via augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR)-offer a promising solution. Leveraging IoT-like laboratory-based viral shedding data together with demographic and clinical features, this study aims to develop a data-driven digital twin model for precision viral surveillance to monitor EIDs and to provide an immersive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine protocols within the Metaverse.\\nMETHODS: We proposed a digital twin thread architecture, comprising a temporal data pipeline designed to support multiple twin functionalities. The process began with the development of the physical twin, which incorporated dynamic cycle threshold (Ct) data from serial RT-PCR tests-serving as IoT-like laboratory inputs along with the associated demographic and clinical data. The underlying parameters of infectious disease dynamics were learned through Markov-based statistical machine learning, applied to these time-series data. A virtual avatar representing these digital threads-a virtual thread cohort-was rendered in virtual reality (VR). Analytic twins, enhanced via AR, overlaid virtual data onto the physical twin to bridge observed and inferred states. Subsequently, decision twins, implemented through MR, were utilized to assess the effectiveness of immersive, precision-guided interventions such as contact tracing, isolation, a'"

September 11, 2025 - The Grey Literature International Steering Committee (GLISC) established in 2006 published guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports. These recommendations are adapted from the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, produced by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) – better known as “Vancouver Style”. Advanced technology enhances both paper and medical technologies (e.g., electronic documentation, telehealth). Final Answer. Concept Map: Technology in Everyday Life. Paper Technology : Printing technology , Digital documentation. Discussion of differences and possible links between bifacially and unifacially shaped tools has quite a long tradition. Certain techno-complexes are distinguished due to the presence or absence of bifacial technology (e.g. Keilmesser group, MP/UP transition leafpoint industries). Abstract This paper examines empirically the relationship between the internal technological profile and the diversification through strategic alliances of the largest 219 industrial firms world-wide. It explores three related issues.'"
